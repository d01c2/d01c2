Currently, I am a member of the [Programming Language Research Group (PLRG)](https://plrg.korea.ac.kr/) at Korea University, advised by [Jihyeok Park](https://plrg.korea.ac.kr/members/jihyeok.park).

## 🎧 Interests

My main research interest is **program analysis**, including both static and dynamic approaches.

Beyond programming, I enjoy coffee, whisk(e)y, and movies—a mix of interests that keeps life balanced.
